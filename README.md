This project explores the application of Hugging Face Transformers to the task of facial emotion recognition.
It leverages the FER2013 dataset, a widely used benchmark for emotion classification from facial expressions.
The project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained [ConvNeXT, ResNet] image classification model from the Hugging Face Model Hub, 
utilizing a feature extraction approach with frozen layers, to achieve competitive results on this challenging task.
